# Aexis

`com.aexis` is the single Unity Package Manager (UPM) package for the Aexis on-device inference engine. AIImage is an application built on Aexis; it is not the engine namespace, a package dependency, or a runtime requirement.

## Status and compatibility

| Item | Supported release baseline |
| --- | --- |
| Unity | 6000.2.7f2 or newer Unity 6.2 patch release |
| Script runtime | Unity .NET profile supplied by Unity 6 |
| GPU path | Compute-shader-capable graphics API with RenderTexture support |
| Package dependencies | Unity built-in `com.unity.modules.imageconversion` and `com.unity.modules.unitywebrequest` for samples; no third-party package |
| Runtime namespaces | `Aexis`, `Aexis.Async`, `Aexis.Onnx`, `Aexis.Ncnn`, `Aexis.Execution` |

`Aexis.Async` uses Unity's built-in `Awaitable`; it does not ship, vendor, or reference UniTask. This prevents package-level conflicts when a host project uses its own UniTask version or distribution.

## Install

For an embedded package, add the following entry to the consuming project's `Packages/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.aexis": "file:../path-to-aexis/Packages/com.aexis"
  }
}
```

For a registry or Git release, install the published `com.aexis` package through Unity Package Manager. Do not copy `Runtime` files into `Assets`; package-local resources and assembly definitions are part of the runtime contract.

## Package layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Runtime/Core` | Backend-neutral contracts, tensor descriptors, precision and quantization manifests |
| `Runtime/Onnx` | Self-owned ONNX protobuf reader and execution-planning adapters |
| `Runtime/Ncnn` | Self-owned NCNN param/bin readers, graph loader, Pack4 texture execution, operators |
| `Runtime/Execution` | ONNX shape/index texture backend |
| `Runtime/Resources/Aexis` | Compute shaders loaded through `Resources`, owned by the package |
| `Editor` | Package editor tooling |
| `Samples~` | Optional importable examples and their model payloads |
| `Documentation~` | Package documentation rendered by Package Manager |
| `Tests/Editor` | Package boundary and planning tests |

The runtime is partitioned into multiple asmdefs inside one UPM package. Unity supports this arrangement; consumers import only `com.aexis` and get the assemblies transitively. `Aexis.Ncnn` production inference stays on Pack4 RenderTextures and CommandBuffer-compatible texture flows. Compute buffers are limited to immutable uploads and explicit diagnostic paths.

## Quick start

```csharp
using Aexis.Ncnn;

var ops = new NcnnOps();
var session = NcnnInferenceSessionFactory.Create(ops);
using var model = new NcnnBinReader(binStream);
await session.LoadModelAsync(paramText, model);
// Prepare the Pack4 input expected by the model, then execute ForwardPack4.
session.Release();
```

See [API manual](Documentation~/api-manual.md) for input/output ownership and [runner samples](Documentation~/runner-samples.md) for an importable component.

## Samples and model files

Import **Aexis Runner Samples** from Package Manager, then run `Aexis/Samples/Install Runner Sample StreamingAssets`. The command copies the model payload to `Assets/StreamingAssets/AexisRunners`, the conventional Unity location included in a player build. The sample's default paths use that location.

The sample payload includes default model files for Clip, CodeFormer, DeepFillV2, Matting, RealESRGAN, and YOLO. GFPGAN, Stable Diffusion, SD Inpainting, MONAI/VISTA, and QWEN model files are intentionally excluded because of package-size limits. See [model distribution](Documentation~/model-distribution.md) before redistributing any sample model.

## Scope and licensing

The source implementation is released under the MIT license in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md). Aexis does not include Unity Sentis, Tencent ncnn, ONNX Runtime, MNN, MONAI, or VISTA source/binaries as runtime dependencies. Compatibility targets do not imply affiliation or use of upstream code.

Models are separate artifacts with their own licenses and redistribution conditions. A release manager must complete the provenance table in `Documentation~/model-distribution.md` before publishing a package archive containing sample models. Do not place medical data, private goldens, checkpoints, or application-specific tooling in this package.
